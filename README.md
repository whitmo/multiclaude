# multiclaude

A lightweight orchestrator for running multiple Claude Code agents on GitHub repositories.

multiclaude spawns and coordinates autonomous Claude Code instances that work together on your codebase. Each agent runs in its own tmux window with an isolated git worktree, making all work observable and interruptible at any time.

## Philosophy: The Brownian Ratchet

multiclaude embraces a counterintuitive design principle: **chaos is fine, as long as we ratchet forward**.

In physics, a Brownian ratchet is a thought experiment where random molecular motion is converted into directed movement through a mechanism that allows motion in only one direction. multiclaude applies this principle to software development.

**The Chaos**: Multiple autonomous agents work simultaneously on overlapping concerns. They may duplicate effort, create conflicting changes, or produce suboptimal solutions. This apparent disorder is not a bug—it's a feature. More attempts mean more chances for progress.

**The Ratchet**: CI is the arbiter. If it passes, the code goes in. Every merged PR clicks the ratchet forward one notch. Progress is permanent—we never go backward. The merge queue agent serves as this ratchet mechanism, ensuring that any work meeting the CI bar gets incorporated.

**Why This Works**:
- Agents don't need perfect coordination. Redundant work is cheaper than blocked work.
- Failed attempts cost nothing. Only successful attempts matter.
- Incremental progress compounds. Many small PRs beat waiting for one perfect PR.
- The system is antifragile. More agents mean more chaos but also more forward motion.

This philosophy means we optimize for throughput of successful changes, not efficiency of individual agents. An agent that produces a mergeable PR has succeeded, even if another agent was working on the same thing.

## Our Opinions

multiclaude is intentionally opinionated. These aren't configuration options—they're core beliefs baked into how the system works:

### CI is King

CI is the source of truth. Period. If tests pass, the code can ship. If tests fail, the code doesn't ship. There's no "but the change looks right" or "I'm pretty sure it's fine." The automation decides.

Agents are forbidden from weakening CI to make their work pass. No skipping tests, no reducing coverage requirements, no "temporary" workarounds. If an agent can't pass CI, it asks for help or tries a different approach.

### Forward Progress Over Perfection

Any incremental progress is good. A reviewable PR is progress. A partial implementation with tests is progress. The only failure is an agent that doesn't push the ball forward at all.

This means we'd rather have three okay PRs than wait for one perfect PR. We'd rather merge working code now and improve it later than block on getting everything right the first time. Small, frequent commits beat large, infrequent ones.

### Chaos is Expected

Multiple agents working simultaneously will create conflicts, duplicate work, and occasionally step on each other's toes. This is fine. This is the plan.

Trying to perfectly coordinate agent work is both expensive and fragile. Instead, we let chaos happen and use CI as the ratchet that captures forward progress. Wasted work is cheap; blocked work is expensive.

### Humans Approve, Agents Execute

Agents do the work. Humans set the direction and approve the results. Agents should never make decisions that require human judgment—they should ask.

This means agents create PRs for human review. Agents ask the supervisor when they're stuck. Agents don't bypass review requirements or merge without appropriate approval. The merge queue agent can auto-merge, but only when CI passes and review requirements are met.

## Gastown and multiclaude

multiclaude was developed independently but shares similar goals with [Gastown](https://github.com/steveyegge/gastown), Steve Yegge's multi-agent orchestrator for Claude Code released in January 2026.

Both projects solve the same fundamental problem: coordinating multiple Claude Code instances working on a shared codebase. Both use Go, tmux for observability, and git worktrees for isolation. If you're evaluating multi-agent orchestrators, you should look at both.

**Where they differ:**

| Aspect | multiclaude | Gastown |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Agent model | 3 roles: supervisor, worker, merge-queue | 7 roles: Mayor, Polecats, Refinery, Witness, Deacon, Dogs, Crew |
| State persistence | JSON file + filesystem | Git-backed "hooks" for crash recovery |
| Work tracking | Simple task descriptions | "Beads" framework for structured work units |
| Communication | Filesystem-based messages | Built on Beads framework |
| Philosophy | Minimal, Unix-style simplicity | Comprehensive orchestration system |
| Maturity | Early development | More established, larger feature set |

multiclaude aims to be a simpler, more lightweight alternative—the "worse is better" approach. If you need sophisticated orchestration features, work swarming, or built-in crash recovery, Gastown may be a better fit.

### Remote-First: Software is an MMORPG

The biggest philosophical difference: **multiclaude is designed for remote-first collaboration**.

Gastown treats agents as NPCs in a single-player game. You're the player, agents are your minions. This works great for solo development where you want to parallelize your own work.

multiclaude treats software engineering as an **MMORPG**. You're one player among many—some human, some AI. The workspace agent is your character, but other humans have their own workspaces. Workers are party members you spawn for quests. The supervisor coordinates the guild. The merge queue is the raid boss that decides what loot (code) makes it into the vault (main branch).

This means:
- **Your workspace persists**. It's your home base, not a temporary session.
- **You interact with workers, not control them**. Spawn them with a task, check on them later.
- **Other humans can have their own workspaces** on the same repo.
- **The system keeps running when you're away**. Agents work, PRs merge, CI runs.

The workspace is where you hop in to spawn agents, check on progress, review what landed, and plan the next sprint—then hop out and let the system work while you sleep.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
go install github.com/dlorenc/multiclaude/cmd/multiclaude@latest

# Prerequisites: tmux, git, gh (GitHub CLI authenticated)

# Start the daemon
multiclaude start

# Initialize a repository
multiclaude init https://github.com/your/repo

# Create a worker to do a task
multiclaude work "Add unit tests for the auth module"

# Watch agents work
tmux attach -t mc-repo
```

## How It Works

multiclaude creates a tmux session for each repository with three types of agents:

1. **Supervisor** - Coordinates all agents, answers status questions, nudges stuck workers
2. **Workers** - Execute specific tasks, create PRs when done
3. **Merge Queue** - Monitors PRs, merges when CI passes, spawns fixup workers as needed

Agents communicate via a filesystem-based message system. The daemon routes messages and periodically nudges agents to keep work moving forward.

                    isolated git worktrees
```

## Commands

### Daemon

```bash
multiclaude start              # Start the daemon
multiclaude daemon stop        # Stop the daemon
multiclaude daemon status      # Show daemon status
multiclaude daemon logs -f     # Follow daemon logs
multiclaude stop-all           # Stop everything, kill all tmux sessions
multiclaude stop-all --clean   # Stop and remove all state files
```

### Repositories

```bash
multiclaude init <github-url>              # Initialize repository tracking
multiclaude init <github-url> [path] [name] # With custom local path or name
multiclaude list                           # List tracked repositories
multiclaude repo rm <name>                 # Remove a tracked repository
```

### Workspaces

Workspaces are persistent Claude sessions where you interact with the codebase, spawn workers, and manage your development flow. Each workspace has its own git worktree, tmux window, and Claude instance.

```bash
multiclaude workspace add <name>           # Create a new workspace
multiclaude workspace add <name> --branch main  # Create from specific branch
multiclaude workspace list                 # List all workspaces
multiclaude workspace connect <name>       # Attach to a workspace
multiclaude workspace rm <name>            # Remove workspace (warns if uncommitted work)
multiclaude workspace                      # List workspaces (shorthand)
multiclaude workspace <name>               # Connect to workspace (shorthand)
```

**Notes:**
- Workspaces use the branch naming convention `workspace/<name>`
- Workspace names follow git branch naming rules (no spaces, special characters, etc.)
- A "default" workspace is created automatically when you run `multiclaude init`
- Use `multiclaude attach <workspace-name>` as an alternative to `workspace connect`

### Workers

```bash
multiclaude work "task description"        # Create worker for task
multiclaude work "task" --branch feature   # Start from specific branch
multiclaude work "Fix tests" --branch origin/work/fox --push-to work/fox  # Iterate on existing PR
multiclaude work list                      # List active workers
multiclaude work rm <name>                 # Remove worker (warns if uncommitted work)
```

The `--push-to` flag creates a worker that pushes to an existing branch instead of creating a new PR. Use this when you want to iterate on an existing PR.

### Observing

```bash
multiclaude attach <agent-name>            # Attach to agent's tmux window
multiclaude attach <agent-name> --read-only # Observe without interaction
tmux attach -t mc-<repo>                   # Attach to entire repo session
```

### Agent Commands (run from within Claude)

```bash
multiclaude agent send-message <to> "msg"  # Send message to another agent
multiclaude agent send-message --all "msg" # Broadcast to all agents
multiclaude agent list-messages            # List incoming messages
multiclaude agent ack-message <id>         # Acknowledge a message
multiclaude agent complete                 # Signal task completion (workers)
```

### Agent Slash Commands (available within Claude sessions)

Agents have access to multiclaude-specific slash commands:

- `/refresh` - Sync worktree with main branch
- `/status` - Show system status and pending messages
- `/workers` - List active workers for the repo
- `/messages` - Check inter-agent messages

## Working with multiclaude

### What the tmux Session Looks Like

When you attach to a repo's tmux session, you'll see multiple windows—one per agent:

Use standard tmux navigation:
- `Ctrl-b n` / `Ctrl-b p` — Next/previous window
- `Ctrl-b 0-9` — Jump to window by number
- `Ctrl-b w` — Window picker
- `Ctrl-b d` — Detach (agents keep running)

### Workflow: Spawning Workers from Your Workspace

Your workspace is a persistent Claude session where you can spawn and manage workers:

When CI fails, the merge queue can spawn workers to fix it:

```

│  │ ✗ Tests failed: 2 failures in error_test.go                             ││
│  │                                                                         ││

## Architecture

### Design Principles

1. **Observable** - All agent activity visible via tmux. Attach anytime to watch or intervene.
2. **Isolated** - Each agent works in its own git worktree. No interference between tasks.
3. **Recoverable** - State persists to disk. Daemon recovers gracefully from crashes.
4. **Safe** - Agents never weaken CI or bypass checks without human approval.
5. **Simple** - Minimal abstractions. Filesystem for state, tmux for visibility, git for isolation.

### Directory Structure

```
~/.multiclaude/
├── daemon.pid          # Daemon process ID
├── daemon.sock         # Unix socket for CLI
├── daemon.log          # Daemon logs
├── state.json          # Persisted state
├── repos/<repo>/       # Cloned repositories
├── wts/<repo>/         # Git worktrees (supervisor, merge-queue, workers)
├── messages/<repo>/    # Inter-agent messages
└── claude-config/<repo>/<agent>/  # Per-agent Claude configuration (slash commands)
```

### Repository Configuration

Repositories can include optional configuration in `.multiclaude/`:

```
.multiclaude/
├── SUPERVISOR.md   # Additional instructions for supervisor
├── WORKER.md       # Additional instructions for workers
├── REVIEWER.md     # Additional instructions for merge queue
└── hooks.json      # Claude Code hooks configuration
```

## Building

```bash
# Build
go build ./cmd/multiclaude

# Run tests
go test ./...

# Install locally
go install ./cmd/multiclaude
```

## Requirements

- Go 1.21+
- tmux
- git
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) authenticated via `gh auth login`
